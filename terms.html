                <h3>5.2 Interest Rates and Fees</h3>
                <p>
                    Interest rates and fees are determined based on your creditworthiness, income, and other factors. All applicable fees will be disclosed to you before you accept the loan. We will not charge any fees that are not disclosed in your loan agreement.
                </p>

                <h3>5.3 Prepayment</h3>
                <p>
                    You may prepay your loan in full or in part at any time without penalty. Prepayments will be applied first to any accrued interest and then to the principal balance.
                </p>

                <h3>5.4 Default and Collections</h3>
                <p>
                    If you fail to make a payment when due, your loan will be considered in default. Upon default, we may take any action permitted by law to collect the outstanding balance, including but not limited to reporting the delinquency to credit agencies, pursuing collection efforts, and initiating legal proceedings.
